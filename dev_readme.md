# Developer Info

### Build Tools

Linux, Windows and Android use Cmake. MacOS uses Xcode and Cocoapods.

### Ableton Link Source Files

The Ableton Link repository is currently nested as a git submodule in the `macos` folder, since Cocoapods does not play well with dependencies in relative folders below its root.
